It was founded on June 15, 1985, by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after acquiring Topcraft's assets.
//  The studio is known for its high-quality filmmaking and artistry, with films such as Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, and Princess Mononoke.

// The name "Ghibli" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun ghibli, which refers to a hot desert wind, symbolizing the idea that the studio would "blow a new wind through the anime industry".
//  Studio Ghibli has produced 25 feature-length films, with many ranking number one at the box office in Japan in the year of their release.

// The studio has a strong presence in the animation industry and has expanded its portfolio to include various media such as short subjects, television commercials, and two television films.

// In March 2025, Studio Ghibli became part of the debate about artificial intelligence (AI) and creative ownership when OpenAI, an American AI research organization, released an image generator capable of mimicking the studio‚Äôs signature style.
